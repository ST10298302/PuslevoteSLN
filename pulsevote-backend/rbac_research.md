# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Research Summary

## What is RBAC?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that restricts system access based on user roles and permissions. Instead of assigning permissions directly to users, RBAC assigns users to roles, and roles are then assigned permissions. This creates a hierarchical structure where access is controlled through role membership rather than individual user permissions.

## Why is RBAC Important in Web Applications?

RBAC is crucial for web applications because it provides a scalable, maintainable way to manage user permissions across complex systems. It ensures that users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their role, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data or administrative functions. RBAC also simplifies permission management by grouping users with similar access needs, making it easier to audit and modify access controls as organizations grow and change.

## How Different User Roles Could Affect Access in PulseVote?

In PulseVote, different roles would create a clear hierarchy of access and responsibilities:

- **Admin**: Full system access, can create other admins and managers, manage all organizations and polls, view all data, and perform system-wide operations
- **Manager**: Can create and manage organizations, create and manage polls within their organizations, generate join codes, and view results for their organization's polls
- **User**: Can join organizations via join codes, vote in polls within their organizations, and view poll results for polls they're eligible to participate in

## What Could Go Wrong Without Proper RBAC?

Without proper RBAC implementation, serious security vulnerabilities could occur including unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation attacks where users gain higher-level access than intended, data breaches through improper access controls, and inability to audit who accessed what resources. Users could potentially access other organizations' data, vote multiple times, or perform administrative actions they shouldn't be able to perform.

## Real-World Example of RBAC Security Breach

A notable example is the 2017 Equifax data breach, where inadequate access controls allowed attackers to exploit a vulnerability in a web application that lacked proper role-based restrictions. The breach exposed personal information of 147 million people, partly due to insufficient access controls that didn't properly restrict which users could access sensitive customer data. This demonstrates how critical proper RBAC implementation is for protecting sensitive information in web applications.
